👋 Hi, I’m @Stephannie
🌱 As an inexperienced web developer, I'm constantly exploring and learning the intricacies of web development.
🔍 Currently, I'm on the lookout for opportunities to gain practical experience and contribute to open-source projects, where I can further develop my skills and make a positive impact on the web development community.
🚧 While I may be inexperienced, my determination to learn, adapt, and grow makes me an asset to any team looking to foster an inclusive and supportive environment for aspiring developers.

Fun Fact I am a Big Anime Fan
